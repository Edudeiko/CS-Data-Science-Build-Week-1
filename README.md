# CS Build Week I for Data Science Students

For your first CS Build Week, you'll be implementing a few watershed
algorithms that are very often used in the data science world. You've
probably heard of these algorithms before. You might even have an idea
of how they work. But to really solidify your understanding of them,
you're going to implement them and then use your implementation just
like how you would if you'd imported the algorithm from a data science
or machine learning library.

## Deliverables

### Part I

For the first part of this Build Week project, you'll pick one of the
following algorithms to implement:

- [K-Means Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)
- [K-Nearest Neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)
- [Decision Tree Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning)
- [Naive Bayes Classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier)
- [DBSCAN Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN)

Your algorithm, implemented as a Python class, should have the following
methods: `fit` and `predict`. You are only allowed to use base Python,
`numpy`, and `scipy` for the implementation of the core algorithm of
your choice. (For visualization and analysis, you can use other
libraries.) You may reference any outside materials that you need, but
copying and pasting another open-source implementation is strictly
prohibited.

You'll then use your implementation on an appropriate set of data and
compare the results that you got from your implementation against the
results yielded by the versions in the
[sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library.

### Part II

For the second part of this Build Week project, you'll be writing up a
HOW-TO blog entry that describes the algorithm, how to implement it, and
what it's useful for.

Your target audience should be other developers who haven't seen the
algorithm before.

There's no size limit, but a reader should be able to begin
implementation of the algorithm based on the information presented.

Post your entry to any blog site, either your own or a platform like
[Medium](https://medium.com/).
