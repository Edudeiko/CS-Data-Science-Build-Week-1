# [K-Nearest Neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)

K-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for **classification** and **regression**.

In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression:

- In **k-NN classification**, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.
- In **k-NN regression**, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of k nearest neighbors.

k-NN is a type of ***instance-based learning***, or ***lazy learning***, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until function evaluation. Since this algorithm relies on distance for classification, **normalizing the training data can improve its accuracy dramatically**.

Both for classification and regression, a useful technique can be to assign weights to the contributions of the neighbors, so that the nearer neighbors contribute more to the average than the more distant ones. For example, a common weighting scheme consists in giving each neighbor a weight of 1/d, where d is the distance to the neighbor.[5]

The neighbors are taken from a set of objects for which the class (for k-NN classification) or the object property value (for k-NN regression) is known. This can be thought of as the training set for the algorithm, though no explicit training step is required.

A peculiarity of the k-NN algorithm is that it is sensitive to the local structure of the data.
